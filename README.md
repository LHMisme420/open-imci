# open-imci → Offline AI IMCI Assistant

**Goal**: Reduce child mortality by 30–50% in areas with no doctors by putting WHO’s gold-standard IMCI protocol + modern AI directly into the hands of community health workers — 100% offline.

Works on $80 Android phones. No internet ever.

## Current state (Nov 2025)
- Week 0: Repository created
- Target MVP (Feb 2026): Full IMCI flowchart + symptom checker + danger sign detection + offline LLM fine-tuned on 10,000 real cases

## Tech stack
- Flutter (one codebase → Android APK for cheap phones)
- TensorFlow Lite + Gemma-2B-it quantized or Phi-3-mini (runs offline)
- WHO IMCI guidelines (public domain)

## Real partners already interested
(We’ll add UNICEF Venture Fund, MSF, Malaria Consortium once MVP exists)

**One motivated dev can save 10,000+ kids in the next 5 years.**
